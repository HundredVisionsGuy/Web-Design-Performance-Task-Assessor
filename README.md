# Web Design Performance Task Assessor
This project is designed to assess students' ability to code clean, semantic front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for a variety of open-ended tasks and projects.

When selecting skills and practices, we will be using the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) as the final arbiter of styles and best practices. 

## Skills Assessed / Unit Tests
*Syntax*
Some of the things I will be testing for is:
  * element names are all lowercase
  * no inline styles
  * in CSS use expanded syntax

*Semantics*
For semantics, I will be looking at 

*Validation*
  * uses HTML5 doctype
  * lang attribute is set
  * charset is set to utf-8

From [HTML guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Guidelines/Code_guidelines)
and [CSS guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Guidelines/Code_guidelines/)

## Student Tasks
Students will be given a pre-test, a series of tasks to complete that will progress through the skills.

***TODO***
### Pre-assessment
The goal of the pre-assessment is for students to attempt to demonstrate as many of the skills from the post-test as possible

### 1-page HTML document
Students will be asessed on the following traits

### Post-assessment
Students will be given an open-ended web project that will contain all the tests as the pre-assessment to demonstrate what all students have learned
